# LittleSteps

LittleSteps is a modular-monolith web app: a Spring Boot backend and a React PWA frontend, built to run end to end on a Mac with no paid services.

## Prerequisites

- **Docker Desktop**
- **Java 25**: `brew install openjdk@25`, then set `JAVA_HOME` to it in your shell profile
- **Node 24** (pinned by `frontend/.nvmrc` and `engines` in `frontend/package.json`)
- **Maven**: no install needed, use the wrapper (`backend/mvnw`)

Setup steps arrive with Story 1.4 (start and stop scripts).

## Build

```bash
(cd backend && ./mvnw verify)
(cd frontend && npm ci && npm run build)
```

## Layout

deploy/             Dockerfile, compose, image manifest, env examples, scripts
security/           vulnerability scan exceptions

```

## Versions

The backend uses **Spring Boot 4.1.2**, the current GA line: Spring Boot 4.2 was still a release candidate when the repository was scaffolded, so the 4.1 set applies (Spring Modulith 2.1.x, Spring AI 2.0.x).
When Spring Boot 4.2 is GA, these move together: Spring Boot 4.2.x, Spring Modulith 2.2.x and Spring AI 2.1.x.
